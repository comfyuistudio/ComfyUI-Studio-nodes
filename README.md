🎨 Aspect Ratio Nodes for ComfyUI

Smart nodes for calculating and resizing images to any aspect ratio. Supports manual size, auto 1MP sizing, crop/stretch, and horizontal/vertical orientation.

💡 Usage Examples

Default 1MP:
width=0, height=0, aspect_ratio="16:9" → ~1333x750

Width-Based:
width=1920, height=0, aspect_ratio="16:9" → 1920x1080

Manual Override:
width=1920, height=1200, aspect_ratio="16:9" → 1920x1200

Vertical Orientation:
width=0, height=0, aspect_ratio="16:9", direction="Vertical" → ~750x1333
