# ComfyUI Custom Nodes

This repository contains a collection of custom nodes for ComfyUI, designed to enhance your workflow with improved image manipulation and documentation capabilities. Below are the descriptions for each node:




### üìÑ Markdown Link Generator (MarkdownModelNote)

This utility node is designed to generate and display markdown-formatted notes directly within your ComfyUI workflow. It's particularly useful for documenting model usage, linking to external resources, or providing quick information about specific assets.

**Features:**

*   **Dynamic Markdown Generation:** Automatically formats input `url`, `filename`, and `folder` into a clickable markdown link and displays the output folder path.
*   **In-Node Display:** The generated markdown note is displayed directly at the bottom of the node in the ComfyUI interface, providing immediate visual feedback without needing an external 'Show Text' node.

**Inputs:**

*   `url` (STRING): The URL associated with the model or resource.
*   `filename` (STRING): The name of the model file (e.g., `model.safetensors`).
*   `folder` (STRING): The local path where the model is stored (e.g., `App\\ComfyUI\\models\\clip`).

**Outputs:**

*   `markdown_note` (STRING): The generated markdown string. This can be connected to other nodes if needed, but its primary purpose is in-node display.




### üß© Aspect Ratio Image Size (AspectRatioImageSize)

This node helps you determine the appropriate dimensions for your images based on a desired aspect ratio and a specified width. It's crucial for maintaining visual consistency and avoiding distortion when working with various image generation models.

**Features:**

*   **Aspect Ratio Calculation:** Calculates the corresponding height for a given width and aspect ratio.
*   **Horizontal/Vertical Direction:** Allows you to specify whether the aspect ratio applies horizontally or vertically, providing flexibility for different image orientations.

**Inputs:**

*   `width` (INT): The desired width of the image.
*   `aspect_ratio` (STRING): The target aspect ratio (e.g., "1:1", "16:9", "4:3").
*   `direction` (STRING): Specifies if the aspect ratio is applied horizontally or vertically ("Horizontal", "Vertical").

**Outputs:**

*   `width` (INT): The calculated width.
*   `height` (INT): The calculated height.
*   `resolution_label` (STRING): A label showing the calculated resolution (e.g., "1024x576").




### üñºÔ∏è Resize to Aspect Ratio (AspectRatioResizeImage)

This node provides robust image resizing capabilities, allowing you to resize images to a specific width while maintaining a chosen aspect ratio. It offers both stretching and intelligent cropping options to ensure your images fit the desired dimensions without unwanted distortion.

**Features:**

*   **Aspect Ratio Resizing:** Resizes images to a target width and calculated height based on a selected aspect ratio.
*   **Horizontal/Vertical Direction:** Adjusts the aspect ratio application based on horizontal or vertical orientation.
*   **Crop Method Switcher:** Choose between:
    *   **Stretch:** Stretches the image to fit the target dimensions, potentially causing distortion.
    *   **Crop:** Intelligently crops the image to match the target aspect ratio before resizing, preventing stretching and maintaining visual integrity.

**Inputs:**

*   `image` (IMAGE): The input image to be resized.
*   `width` (INT): The desired output width of the image.
*   `aspect_ratio` (STRING): The target aspect ratio (e.g., "1:1", "16:9", "4:3").
*   `direction` (STRING): Specifies if the aspect ratio is applied horizontally or vertically ("Horizontal", "Vertical").
*   `crop_method` (STRING): Determines how the image is adjusted to the aspect ratio ("Stretch", "Crop").

**Outputs:**

*   `resized_image` (IMAGE): The resized image.
*   `resolution_label` (STRING): A label showing the final resolution (e.g., "1024x576").
